some smallscripts
============

Collection of small programs that I use every couple of months/years.
Not suitable for production enviroments. Badly written. Modify for your own use.

## backupslapd
## cronstrip
## crontablist
## debian_remove_unused_kernels
## dnsbulkcompare
## fritzbox.remote.manager

Something I saw in a request in a webserver log files. Allows for remote root access on some FRITZ!Box versions.

## htmlsed
## memorybloat
## sshforward
## uid_sorted

Output a sorted and padded list of all uids used on a Linux system. Makes ugly use of `perl`, `sort` and `getent`.
